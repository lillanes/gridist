# Gridist #
 
 A simple framework for online grid-based pathfinding. To be used with [Nathan Sturtevant's benchmarks](http://movingai.com/benchmarks).
 
 The idea behind this framework is to study if and when the freespace assumption may not be a reasonable assumption, and some possible alternatives to it. The alternatives involve having some form of probability distribution over the set of possible grids, given the existing observations.
